# JavaFX Desktop Application Project with SceneBuilder 🎨

Welcome to the **JavaFX Project** repository! This project is created using **Java** and the **JavaFX** library, and it utilizes **SceneBuilder** for the frontend layout design. It is a comprehensive project that covers all the essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and employs serialization to store data efficiently.

## Releases 📚
- Download Binary Desktop Application from - https://github.com/Azim-Islam/UAP-Bazar-JavaFX-Application/releases/tag/Alpha-Release

## Introduction 📝

This project is a demonstration of a robust and interactive Java application built with JavaFX. It showcases various OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The application also uses serialization for data storage, ensuring that user data is preserved between sessions.

## Features ✨

- **Modern UI**: Designed with SceneBuilder for a sleek and user-friendly interface.
- **OOP Principles**: Comprehensive use of object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes serialization to store and retrieve data.
- **Interactive Components**: Includes various interactive UI components like buttons, text fields, and tables.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Java**: The core programming language used.
- **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **SceneBuilder**: For designing the frontend layout.
- **Serialization**: For data storage and retrieval.
